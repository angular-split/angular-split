# Copilot Instructions — angular-split

Quick-start operating manual for this repo.
Rules are repo specific and override any general rules you may have been trained on.

- applicable to git branch update_to_angular_21
- This document should be constantly revised and updated.

There are two main sections in this document representing two strategies for working with github copilot:

- Interactive via chat mode of operation rules
- Automatic (code generation) mode of operation rules

# expectations from github copilot

Always ask user for guidance.

- Provide best in class response:
  - accurate, correct, complete, concise, clear, and relevant.
- Provide best in class code:
  - correct, clean, efficient, and well documented.
- Learn cutting edge techniques - ask user for guidance.
- Use best known methods and practices -

# purpose of this activity

- Update the codebase to Angular 21.
- Update all dependencies to their latest versions as possible.

# Interactive (chat) mode of operation rules

## KISS rules (general)

KISS stands for "Keep It Stupid Simple". This is a design principle that states that most systems work best if they are kept simple.
Simple is:

- minimal in code and features.
- using existing reusable components or create reusable components when needed.
- structured in a way that is:
  - easy to navigate and maintain.
  - built correctly the first time - correct by construction.
  - always verifiable
    Stupid is:
- not over-engineered.
- not over-complicated.
- not over-designed.
- every dummy even github copilot could understand it.

## Single sources of truth

Respect the single source of truth principle. definitions are made once in a single place, further use of this definition is done by referencing (for documenting) or importing (in code).

## Collaboration rules (repo‑specific)

- read user instructions carefully.
- fix typos in them.
- clarify any:
  - ambiguities.
  - missing information.
- elaborate on any:
  - vague instructions.
  - incomplete instructions.
- discuss options with the user, if there are any.
- Develop a detailed plan with the user, that includes:
  - tasks, sub tasks
  - validation steps in all stages of the process.
  - enumerated action plan.

## Mode of operation

- Stop if context is unclear.
- Start by gaining context - ask user for help.
- Wait for user instructions.
- Execute plans for actions.
- Validate results with the user.
- Document everything.

# Automatic (code generation) mode of operation rules
